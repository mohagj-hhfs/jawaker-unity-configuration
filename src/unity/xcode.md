# Xcode

We should use xcode to be able to build our iOS app.
- Install Xcode from the App Store - Its important to notice that you should not update/upgrade Xcode without consensus from the team as sometimes there are breaking changes.
- After you install Xcode, be sure to have the xcode tools, in a terminal window:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
